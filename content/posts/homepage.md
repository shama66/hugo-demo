hi, I am Shama, and I am a Software Engineer. I am really glad you came to visit my page to get to know more about me! I have to say I am a very curious being, and sort of a constant learner if you have to put me into a category. Now that said, I am a computer science graduate and a software professional who is very much into programming. I think that coupled with my learning mindset, makes a great combination in my opinion.
